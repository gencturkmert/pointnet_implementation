# PointNet Implementation
Created by Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, Leonidas J. Guibas from Stanford University. 

# Introduction
This work is based on [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) paper. It proposed a novel deep net architecture for point clouds (as unordered point sets). Original paper is implemented in PyTorch with classification and segmentation modules. You can also check original project webpage for a deeper introduction. ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 datasets are used.
